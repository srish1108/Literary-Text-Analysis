### Bibliotherapy

[Bibliotherapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bibliotherapy#:~:text=Bibliotherapy%20) is the study of literary texts and their effects on the reader as a means of therapy. It is found to be useful in treatment of mental health especially patients with [mild depression](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cpp.1814). The literary texts used are often selected from the self help genre but sometimes fiction and graphic novels (in the case of children) are used too.

### Project

This project takes its roots from Computational Linguistics. It is divided into multiple components for a comprehensive understanding of what factors play a major role in selecting literary texts for the purpose of Bibliotherapy. Here are the steps:

- Prepare and extract a copyright free list of books known to have been used in Bibliotherapy

- Create a sentiment analyzer and plot graphs that show the range of sentiments in the entire text

- Use NLP techniques for text preprocessing to prepare the data for further analysis

- Extract the most used words across all texts post lexical analysis

- Compare the texts in terms of sentiments and linguistics to learn the similarities among them for further use

### My Book Sentiment

This part of the project constitutes the first two aspects of analyzing the sentiments of the classic literary novels. 

The libraries used are Pandas, NLTK and Matplotlib. Vader's sentiment analyzer is used to conduct the sentiment analysis.

The list of novels is retrieved from [Tolstoy Therapy](https://www.tolstoytherapy.com/bibliotherapy-recommendations/).
The books are extracted from [Project Gutenberg](http://gutenberg.org/) which includes a vast number of copyright free ebooks.

The novels used in this project are classics and are as follows: 

- A Little Princess, by Frances Hodgson Burnett
- War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy
- The Count of Monte Cristo, by Alexandre Dumas
- Jane Eyre, by Charlotte Bronte
- The Odyssey, by Homer
- Meditations, by Marcus Aurelius
- Great Expectations, by Charles Dickens
- The Enchanted April, by Elizabeth von Arnim

A common observation in the sentiment analysis of the books altogether is that they have a positive mean and most of the book ranges from neutral (0) to positive (+1). While the average mean of the overall sentiments of the books is closer to 0, in other words the texts don't exhibit a strong positive or negative theme. While each book as a whole has sentiments varying from negative(-1) to positive(+1), there is a corresponding variation in themes. The strong positive sentiments utilize themes of love, joy and happiness while strong negative ones talk about grief, violence, tragedy and so on.

There are two graphs which indicate the sentiments, and by extension themes, displayed throughout the individual texts. The first graph shows the high positive (green) sentiment being balanced by negative (orange) and neutral ones. The second graph displays the overall sentiment with its mean.

Here are some of the graphs for you take a look at:
